I want to summarize my requirements for blog and the effort I took to build one based on Jekyll and hosted on Github.

## Requirements

My primary requirement was perfect support for code blocks as I want to write primarily about programming. Second requirement was markdown support. I like the language and it seem very reasonable to me to use it for blog. Also I generally like to have more control over what I do.

In the past, I used wordpress, but there were several drawbacks I couldn't get over. Mainly the code blocks support wasn't out of the box and one had to search for plugins and then research how to install and use them... I never managed to get to some solution that I would be satisfied with. Another drawback was admin interface, that was just out of my capabilities...
There were also few things I liked, support for drafts, mobile client was working well.

I came across Jekyll several times, but it was not my cup of tea as I am Ruby virgin. But then...

I found an article that mentioned one GitHub repo that served as a template for jekyll-based site/blog. And it could even be used manually, without any Ruby stuff. That seemed like good idea to me and after a while messing around I ended up with this. So what effort did it take?

## Effort

Note that detailed description is provided with the template itself, but I want to summarize the steps I took so I can reffer to it later. If somebody else finds it useful I'd be pleased.

### 1. Fork

Easy enough. Link

### 1b. Fetch

Easier file manipulation - GitHub for desktop, typora

### 2. Configuration.yml

### 3. First post

### 4. Drafts

### 5. Header image

### 6. something else in commits?
