Here I want to test all features of the template. There are several things in front matter you can see in raw (excerpt, tags, category, toc).

## Code:

```csharp
var something = new Something(5, true, new SomethingElse());
StaticThing.Call();
```

{% highlight csharp linenos %}
var something = new Something(5, true, new SomethingElse());
StaticThing.Call();
{% endhighlight %}

### Gist:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/vatioz/3c7e7c53ba885d46d726d3d7350c9b81.js"></script>

#### Notices:

Very nice boxes can be crated by applying .notice--classes
{: .notice--warning}
