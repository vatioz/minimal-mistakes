Here I want to test all features of the template. There are several things in front matter you can see only in raw/code view (excerpt, tags, category, toc).

## Code

### Fenced syntax

```csharp
var something = new Something(5, true, new SomethingElse());
StaticThing.Call();
```

### Jekyll highlight

{% highlight csharp linenos %}
var something = new Something(5, true, new SomethingElse());
StaticThing.Call();
{% endhighlight %}

### Gist

<script src="https://gist.github.com/vatioz/3c7e7c53ba885d46d726d3d7350c9b81.js"></script>

### Inline

For code inline I can use `ticks`

## Others

### Notices

Very nice boxes can be crated by applying .notice--classes
{: .notice--warning}

### Quotes

> quotation of something very smart

### Horizontal line

you can do it

---

using three (or more) dashes or asterisks or underscores

## Links

### Automatic

Full url is not converted automatically https://www.google.com

### Manual

First are [square brackets](https://google.com) and then round ones. The mnemonic help is: Test vs Url? T is before U, T is sharp, U is round.
